            <h2>Better Professors App</h2>

            <p>As a professor, I have a lot of grad students I mentor. Iâ€™d like to help keep them on track, but I can never remember their project deadlines, or when my feedback to them is due. </p>

            <h4>What it Does</h4>

         <p>The Better Professors App helps professors by keeping track of important dates, such as holidays or breaks, and once a student profile is created, it lets the user add projects by student. Once a project is added, the user can keep track of it by setting a notification that will remind the user to reachout to that student BEFORE the approaching deadline. </p>
